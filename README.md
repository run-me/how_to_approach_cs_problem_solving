# The art of problem solving
<b>"The art of problem solving is deeply rooted inside every person's though process, it takes time
and effort to pull it out to show it to the world"</b>

In every day life we solve so many problems without even acknowledging it, lets take an example:

1. It's 56 degrees outside and sun shines so bright that it cannot be more perfect to go for a
hike, you get a call from your friend and he asks you to search for his laptop charger which 
he left at your place yesterday. What do you do? 

Ans. I would try to remember which room we were at watching netflix with his laptop and start searching
from there. Woila! You are performing a search algorithm in your brain without even realizing it.

We use search algorithm a lot in our every day and to improve our search we sort the things where
we search for particular items in any space.

With this intuition lets begin our journey with approaching DS and Algorithms for problem solving.

Algorithm topics you should be aware of and you should work on:
1. Search Algorithms [pretty straight forward]
2. Sorting Algorithms [you need this to improve the previous one]
3. Graph Algorithms [whatt?? read explaination to understand better]
Things get little weird after this
4. Bitwise Algorithms [operations on 010101 stuff, btw the decimal repesentation of that value is 21]
5. Pattern Matching/Searching Algorithms
6. Math Algorithms
7. If your greedy for more check out [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)

Algorithmic paradigm:
1. Divide and Conquer
2. Greedy 
3. Dynamic Programming
4. Backtracking [ one of the most useful way of thinking _/\\\_ ]
5. Branch and Bound


#### Graph resource
A foot note : Graph can be used to represent or model any real world systems or problem.
Graphs can be used to represent any collection of objects having some kind of pair wise relationship

Examples: 
1. Social networks like FB can be represented as a undirected graph, because friendship is mutual relationship
2. Interlinked web pages or the websites in the world wide web is a directed graph.
3. Web crawling is something which has a funky term but its nothing but graph traversal, lol!

I followed graph explanation from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXgEDyodOJU), he explains the concept
very well and I recommend watching the consecutive videos then practice implementation and jump into solving problems

Types of graphs, 4 types as weight and directions are taken into consideration:
1. Unweighted Undirected Graph
2. Unweighted Directed Graph
3. Weighted Undirected Graph
4. Weighted Directed Graph
