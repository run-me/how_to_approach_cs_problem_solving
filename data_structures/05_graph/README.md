## Graph G = (V, E)
#### A foot note on the topic: 
Graph can be used to represent or model any real world systems or problem.
Graphs can be used to represent any collection of objects having some kind of pair wise relationship.
A graph has a vertex and a edge eg: A ---- B where A and B is vertex and ---- is the edge.

<b>Examples:</b> 
1. Social networks like FB can be represented as a undirected graph, because friendship is mutual relationship
2. Interlinked web pages or the websites in the world wide web is a directed graph.
3. Web crawling is something which has a funky term but its nothing but graph traversal, lol!

I followed graph explanation from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXgEDyodOJU), he explains the concept
very well and I recommend watching the consecutive videos then practice implementation and jump into solving problems

<b>Types of graphs, 4 types as weight and directions are taken into consideration:</b>
1. Unweighted Undirected Graph.  A ---- B
2. Unweighted Directed Graph. A ----> B
3. Weighted Undirected Graph. A -- 4 -- B
4. Weighted Directed Graph. A -- 4 --> B

<b>Some more terminology</b>

Degrees of a vertex: Number of edges connected from the current vertex to other vertex 

C <---- A ----> B<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E

has degree of 3
