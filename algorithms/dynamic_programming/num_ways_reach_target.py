"""
Letâ€™s try the same for one more problem: counting the number of ways to reach a given score in a game
Consider a game where a player can score 3 or 5 or 10 points at a time. Given a total score n, find the
number of ways to reach the given score. The order of scoring does not matter.

eg : sum = 20
     points = {3, 5, 10}
expected output -> 4
number of ways to reach -> (10, 10) (5, 5, 10) (5, 5, 5, 5) (3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5)
